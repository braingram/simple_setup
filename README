This is a super simple setup.py that should require little to no customization.

It will:

1) find packages: using setuptools.find_packages('.')
2) find scripts: any non-.pyc file in ./scripts
3) find package data: any non-module, non-test subdirectories in a package
4) parse requirements.txt (if available)
5) automatically name the package: same name as first package found

I need to find a good way to include this file in many existing git repos
One option would be:
1) at start of new repo, clone simple_setup
2) have a clean.sh that is part of simple_setup repo that
2a) deletes .git
2b) deletes this readme
2c) deletes clean.sh??
Options 2 would be to see if git tags allows me to include only setup.py
