This is a super simple setup.py that should require little to no customization.

It will:

1) find packages: using setuptools.find_packages('.')
2) find scripts: any non-.pyc file in ./scripts
3) find package data: any non-module, non-test subdirectories in a package
4) parse requirements.txt (if available)
5) automatically name the package: same name as first package found
6) fetch version from module.__version__ (or default to 'dev')
7) get author info from ~/.pypirc (section: simple_setup, options: author, author_name)
