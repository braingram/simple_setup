This is a super simple setup.py that should require little to no customization.

It will:

1) find packages: using setuptools.find_packages('.')
2) find scripts: any non-.pyc file in ./scripts
3) find package data: any non-module, non-test subdirectories in a package
4) parse requirements.txt (if available)
5) automatically name the package: same name as first package found

To easily use this in a project, simply pull the latest version from gh-pages

    wget http://braingram.github.com/simple_setup/setup.py
